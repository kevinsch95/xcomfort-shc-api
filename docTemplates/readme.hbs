This module lets you send commands from node.js to the Xcomfort smart home controller(SHC)
made by Eaton. It has no affiliation with Eaton, and is used at your own risk.

If you have xcomfort and a smart home controller at home, this module
can be used to create custom software for your system.
For example you can create a webpage customized for your home that controls
your lighting instead of that generic app that ships with the SHC

The project is in a very early development stage, and the api can end up being changed dramatically.

### Install
```bash
npm install xcomfort-shc-api
```

### Usage
For more details on usage see [https://oanylund.github.io/xcomfort-shc-api](https://oanylund.github.io/xcomfort-shc-api)
 and the [API referance](#api) below.
```js
const Xcomfort = require('xcomfort-shc-api');

const xapi = new Xcomfort({
  baseUrl: 'http://192.168.0.10', // The url to reach the SHC on your network
  username: 'user', // The username to login to the system
  password: '1234' // The password for that user
  autoSetup: true // Defaults to true.
});

xapi.on('ready', () => {
  xapi.setDimState('kitchen light', 20)
    .then((status) => {
      if(status) {
        console.log('Kitchen light set to 20%');
      }
    });
});
```
